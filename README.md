# Image Processing & Detection Demo

### OpenCV is required to run the following demo: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/

When using openCV, you can place a bounding box around a region of interest:

![Object Detection](https://github.com/gmaldona/ImageProcessing-DetectionDemo/blob/main/Demo%20Images/openCV%20Camera.png)

In the case of the final project, the object detected will be a full length body walking. We can simulate this in the demo by just drawing the bounding box that represents where a person would be detected in a frame.

In the next frame, that would walk in a direction and would show up at a different (x, y, z) position.
